### Ashley Towner

I am a software engineer working mostly in React & TypeScript. 

I do a lot of my work in the terminal and use a lot of CLI tools. Feel free to check out my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/ashleytowner/dotfiles) for inspiration. 

#### What's with all the brainfuck?

When learning a new programming language, I like to write a brainfuck interpreter in it, since it's not too hard but it gives you a good feel for the language and makes you use a bunch of its features.
